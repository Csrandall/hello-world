Hey, Hey.

Cody Randall es my name. Just trying to get surface level knowledge of coding before starting on my classes next semester. 
Currently in school for a computer programming degree but at a 2 year institute, then moving on. 
Havent taken any computer classes yet but doing it on my own terms outside of class makes me realize just how much I enjoy it.
In love with a girl named Eve, take fim photo's and I guess you could say I'm a pretty good cook? (I've only been a line cook for like 5 years now....[sadly])
